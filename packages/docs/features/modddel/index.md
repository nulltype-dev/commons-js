# DDD model framework

This is simple framework designed to support implementation of the DDD principles and provide structured approach to approach to building robust and maintainable applications. Below is an introduction to the key concepts and components of our DDD Model Framework.

## Installation

```bash
npm i @nulltype/modddel
```

## Value object

Value objects are objects without a distinct identity. They are used to describe characteristics or attributes of entities. Our framework provides a concise way to model and handle value objects.

## Aggregate root

Aggregates are groups of related entities and value objects treated as a single unit. The aggregate root is the entry point for interactions with the aggregate. The framework supports the definition and management of aggregates in your domain model.

## Domain events

Domain events represent significant state changes in your domain. The framework includes support for defining and handling domain events, enabling loose coupling between different parts of your system.

## Repository

Repositories provide a mechanism for accessing and persisting aggregates. Our DDD Model Framework includes a repository pattern that helps you abstract the data access layer and work with aggregates in a consistent manner.
